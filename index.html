                                            The objective of this game is to type all of the displayed words faster than your opponent. Be careful of the traffic light, though... <br><br>
                                            When the light is <span class = "glowgreen">green</span>, you're free to type. Go as fast as you can for the finish line! <br>
                                            When the light is <span class = "glowyellow">yellow</span>, you can keep typing, but be ready to stop before the light changes again. <br>
                                            When the light is <span class = "glowred">red</span>, STOP typing. If you type when the light is red, you're out!
